# Particle Simulator

A Python-based particle simulator featuring physics-like particle movement, customizable behavior, and statistics tracking. This project demonstrates interactive simulation with Python and is ideal for exploring physics-based visuals or learning particle system concepts.

---

## Features

- Particle movement with configurable properties (velocity, direction, lifespan, color, etc.)
- Dynamic simulation that updates in real time
- Particle statistics tracking via `particle_stats.json`
- Configuration-driven setup using the `config/` folder
- Compatible with Python 3.13+

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (3.13 recommended)
- Standard Python libraries: `json`, `os`, `random`, `math`
- Optional virtual environment for isolation

---

## Setup

1. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/particle_simulator
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv_quartz
source venv_quartz/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies if needed (currently, only standard libraries are used).

---

## Running the Simulator

Run the main particle simulator script:

```bash
python3 main2.py
```

The simulator will start, and particle movement will appear in the console or GUI window depending on your implementation.

---

## Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` folder.

Default settings include:

* Number of particles
* Particle speed and direction
* Lifespan and colors

Modify `config/config.json` or other JSON files to customize particle behavior.

## Git and Version Control

Exclude runtime or generated files in `.gitignore`:

```
venv_quartz/
*.pyc
__pycache__/
```
